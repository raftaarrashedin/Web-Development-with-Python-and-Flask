	<h1>Why Flask?</h1>
	<h3>Hii, I am {{name}} , and I am going to teach you flask</h3>

## Reason 1: Highly Scalable
In today’s fast-paced environment, most people start with a small web app idea and then scale it as per the requirements. Now, if you’re associated with a startup or small business, you want to develop your web application through a highly scalable framework. Flask is one such framework that fits your requirements. It can process a high number of requests as your business scales up with time. For example, Pinterest moved from Django to Flask and is processing billions of requests per day. The reason behind the scalable nature of Flask is its ability to modularize the codebase as it grows over a specific period. It allows developers to segregate them as chucks.

## Reason 2: Easy to Use and Flexible
As a developer, when you’re choosing the web application development framework, you will look for one that allows you to customize the code as per your requirements. Flask is one such web framework, so it has a massive user base among the tech community. There are very few parts of Flask that you can’t change or alter. Compared to Django, Flask is open to change, and it adds a layer of flexibility to the web app development process. Furthermore, the framework is straightforward to use and understand, even for a newbie. The primary reason behind the simplicity of Flask is its documentation that becomes handy for developers in case of confusion.

## Reason 3: Greater Control Over Codes
Flask is one of the most recognized web app frameworks that allow developers to have complete control over the codebase, which is small. The framework enables developers to choose the components they want for a specific application. Moreover, Flask empowers developers to make decisions while selecting the components for development. It also provides control over the various extensions that you get with the framework. For example, suppose you’re developing a web application that doesn’t involve the usage of database access or form validation. In that case, developers can exclude that and only use relevant ones during the development.

## Reason 4: Support for Testing
After development, the next phase in the software development life cycle is testing. Unfortunately, in most web application frameworks, you won’t find the testing option. So, you have to find a testing framework separately and perform the required procedure. In the case of Flask, you get an in-built unit testing facility that enables you to test your app before making it live in production. In addition, the framework provides features such as a built-in development server, a fast debugger, and restful request dispatching. This contributes to making the testing process seamless for a development team. Moreover, the framework is extremely lightweight.

## Reason 5: Facilitates Experimentation
In the modern era, you want a web application framework to experiment with the development approach. That’s where Flask can be your best bet. It will enable you to adapt to emerging technologies and work through agile development methodologies. Faster implementation is one of the USPs of the Flask framework, and that’s why it made its name among the Python community. If the developer wants to add more and more features to its product as it becomes famous, Flask could be a great option. It will enable developers to make continuous improvements to their products with quick integration and support systems.

## Reason 6: Shallow Learning Curve
When web app developers select the framework for their project, they will think about the learning curve, whether it’s steep or shallow. Naturally, you want to opt for the framework with a shallow learning curve, and that’s where Flask outscores all the other python frameworks. Understanding the concept of Flask is not a complex task, and that’s why developers love it. Even a fresher can learn Flask within a few weeks if he has basic knowledge of the python programming language. This is why this framework is increasing in usage and popularity and will take center stage in the upcoming years as far as web app development is concerned.

## Wrapping Up Things
Flask is one of the most popular micro-framework for web application development in recent times. The framework has made a name for itself among the Python developer community and web application developers across the globe. In this blog, we have explored its reasons and provided you with a holistic view of the Flask framework.</p>
